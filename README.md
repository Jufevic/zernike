# Zernike

Python code for Zernike polynomials. This module was part of
[enzpy](https://github.com/jacopoantonello/enzpy) but will be further developed
here instead.

# Installation

### Linux

```bash
python setup.py develop --user
```

### Windows

- You should first install the following requirements:
    - [Anaconda for Python 3](https://www.anaconda.com/download). This includes
      Python as well as some necessary scientific libraries.
    - [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win). This is necessary for the
      automatic version numbering of this package. Also, make sure you choose
      *Git from the command line and also 3rd-party software* in *Adjusting
      your PATH environment*.
- *Clone* this repository using Git. From any folder in File Explorer,
  right-click and hit *Git Bash here*. Paste `git clone
  https://github.com/jacopoantonello/zernike` and hit enter. Do not use
  GitHub's *Download ZIP* button above, as the installation script will not
  work in that case.
- Finally, double-click on `install.bat`.
